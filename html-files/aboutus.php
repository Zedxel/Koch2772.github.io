        <p>Mythical Creature Parts (MCP) is a company dedicated to the ethical retail sales of the parts of mythical creatures which are in high demand and extremely hard to source without venturing into the black market.</p>

        <p>MCP stocks those parts of mythical creatures that are used for healing, music, decoration, and fashion.  The parts are sustainably sourced from  mythical creatures which have shed the item through natural growth, lost that part in an argument with another mythical creature, or have died from old age or from the aforementioned mythical creature argument.</p>
